# Microservices

Microservices are a software development technique â€” a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight. The benefit of decomposing an application into different smaller services is that it improves modularity and makes the application easier to understand, develop, test, and become more resilient to architecture erosion.

## Microservices Architecture

- **Microservices** - A microservices architecture is a design pattern that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight. The benefit of decomposing an application into different smaller services is that it improves modularity and makes the application easier to understand, develop, test, and become more resilient to architecture erosion.
- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** - A service-oriented architecture is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network. The basic principles of service-oriented architecture are independent of vendors, products, and technologies.
